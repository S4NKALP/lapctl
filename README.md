**lapctl** is a fast and easy command line tool made in Rust. It helps you control your Linux laptop hardware from the terminal.

You can use it to change your graphics card mode, set battery charge limits, pick power profiles, and control the cooling fans. It talks directly to your system hardware, so it does not need any heavy background programs to run.

## What It Can Do

**Graphics Control**

Easily switch between Integrated, Nvidia, and Hybrid graphics modes to save battery or get more power.

**Battery Health**

Set a battery charge limit like 80% to make your battery last longer over the years.

**Power Saving**

Change power profiles and set CPU power limits to save energy when you need it.

**Cooling Control**

Control the cooling fans for laptops like Lenovo or ASUS to keep your computer quiet or cool.

**Sleep Inhibitor**

Prevent your system from sleeping or suspending while running a task or indefinitely.

**Hardware Status**

Check the status of your battery, graphics, and power all in one place.
